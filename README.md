A [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org) [Workbench](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Workbenches) that provides a terminal on the USB port and file upload via USB connection.

## Introduction:

**USBTerminal** is part of a [Suite](https://prrvchr.github.io/) of extensions allowing to offer you innovative services in Open Source Sofware.  

Being free software I encourage you:
- To duplicate its [source code](https://github.com/prrvchr/USBTerminal).
- To make changes, corrections, improvements.
- To open [issue](https://github.com/prrvchr/USBTerminal/issues/new) if needed.

In short, to participate in the development of this extension.
Because it is together that we can make Free Software smarter.

## Historical:

Here is some time I try to integrate a USB connection in FreeCAD.
Thanks to the library PySerial.

There is little time I saw the new Path module with a lot of Python, which allowed me to better organize my files ...
Thanks to FreeCAD developers ...

The ultimate goal will be to transfer cn files (Gcode) to a platform in the occurrence a TinyG2 (DUE Arduino + Gshield of Synthetos).

Now I have a connection that runs on a terminal mode.
A file upload function...
And a position feedback draw in real time on screen...

Besides, any help is welcome
